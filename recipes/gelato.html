            <li><b>Prepare the chicken:</b> Cook the chicken if it's not already cooked. You can grill, bake, or boil the chicken until it's fully cooked and tender.</li>
            <li><b>Mix with barbecue sauce:</b> In a mixing bowl, combine the shredded chicken with barbecue sauce.If the barbecue sauce is too thick, add about 1/4 cup of water to the mixture and stir until the chicken is evenly coated.</li>
            <li><b>Fill the popsicle molds:</b> Carefully spoon the chicken and barbecue sauce mixture into the popsicle molds. Press down gently to make sure there are no air pockets, and fill the molds to the top.</li>
            <li><b>Add edible flowers:</b> Before placing the sticks into the molds, insert a few edible flowers into each popsicle mold, arranging them in a visually appealing way. The flowers will add a touch of color and glamour to the popsicles.</li>
            <li><b>Insert sticks:</b> Lit that.</li>
            <li><b>Freeze the popsicles:</b> Put the popsicle molds in the freezer and allow them to freeze completely. It may take around 4-6 hours, depending on your freezer's temperature.</li>
            <li><b>Unmold and serve:</b> Once the popsicles are frozen, remove them from the molds by running warm water on the outside of the molds for a few seconds. Gently pull the popsicles out.</li>
